PowerSwitch3
============

SqueezeServer Plugin to control an amplifier's power state based on a power states of multiple devices

This project is based directly on Felix's PowerSwitch II:

The intent is to be able to use the power state of one or more squeezebox clients (e.g., multiple instances of squeezeLite on a PogoPlug) in conjunction with the ir/geek port of a SqueezeBox/Transporter to control a multi-zone amplifier's power state.

Oh, yeah, and it doesn't work yet
